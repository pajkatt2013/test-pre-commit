Below is a concise, measurable plan with two priorities each for Assignment, Business, and Development. These priorities are tailored to your role as a DevOps Engineer on BMW’s Autonomous Driving Platform (ADP) project, running on AWS EKS.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. ASSIGNMENT PRIORITIES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Priority 1: Maintain High Availability and Stability of the EKS Clusters
• Measurable Goal: Achieve 99.9% EKS cluster uptime (excluding planned maintenance) and resolve 80% of critical incidents within 2 hours.  
• Corresponding Activities:  
  – Implement robust monitoring/alerting for critical workloads (using CloudWatch, Grafana).  
  – Conduct weekly cluster health checks, ensuring pods and services run within targeted resource thresholds.  
  – Create incident runbooks and standard operating procedures to expedite issue resolution.

Priority 2: Streamline CI/CD Pipelines for Faster Delivery
• Measurable Goal: Reduce average deployment time by 30% (e.g., from 10 minutes to 7 minutes) and target a deployment success rate of 95%.  
• Corresponding Activities:  
  – Optimize build and test stages by introducing parallel jobs and caching solutions.  
  – Establish automated rollback/failover strategies to minimize downtime.  
  – Conduct monthly reviews of pipeline metrics (build duration, success rate) to identify and implement incremental improvements.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2. BUSINESS PRIORITIES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Priority 1: Enhance Resource Efficiency and Cost Management
• Measurable Goal: Decrease monthly AWS cost by 15% through optimal resource usage (e.g., using Spot Instances, right-sizing clusters).  
• Corresponding Activities:  
  – Set up cost dashboards in CloudWatch or Grafana, reviewing usage metrics weekly.  
  – Implement right-sizing recommendations for CPU/memory based on utilization patterns.  
  – Introduce scaling policies (HPA, cluster autoscaler) to match workload demand and avoid idle resources.

Priority 2: Accelerate Go-to-Market for Autonomous Driving Features
• Measurable Goal: Increase frequency of feature rollout from once every two sprints to once per sprint while maintaining quality standards (no critical regressions post-release).  
• Corresponding Activities:  
  – Collaborate with development teams to define clear release schedules and acceptance criteria for new ADP features.  
  – Integrate automated end-to-end tests into CI/CD pipelines to catch issues early.  
  – Conduct sprint retrospectives focusing on release bottlenecks and implement continuous improvements.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3. DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Priority 1: Advance Cloud-Native & DevOps Expertise
• Measurable Goal: Obtain at least one relevant certification (e.g., AWS Certified DevOps Engineer – Professional) by Q4 and contribute to two internal or external tech talks on EKS best practices.  
• Corresponding Activities:  
  – Allocate 2–3 hours per week for studying official AWS or Kubernetes documentation and practice exams.  
  – Prepare and present knowledge-sharing sessions to the internal team about container orchestration or DevOps tooling.  
  – Engage in community forums or local meetups to keep up-to-date with industry trends.

Priority 2: Strengthen Leadership and Project Coordination Skills
• Measurable Goal: Lead two mini-initiatives within the ADP project (e.g., a pilot solution for a new monitoring tool or an incident response drill) and mentor at least one junior engineer by year-end.  
• Corresponding Activities:  
  – Organize and run project kick-off meetings, defining scope, timeline, and success metrics.  
  – Provide regular feedback and guidance to your mentee, helping them resolve at least one complex operational issue independently.  
  – Schedule quarterly check-ins with your People Manager to assess leadership progress and refine improvement plans.

SUMMARY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
By focusing on these six priorities—two each for Assignment, Business, and Development—you’ll maintain and improve the AWS EKS environment for BMW’s Autonomous Driving Platform, contribute measurable business value, and enhance your professional growth. Regularly review these metrics and activities with your People Manager and Assignment Manager to stay on track and adapt as project needs evolve.
